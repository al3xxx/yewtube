# Improvements and Modernization of yewtube

This document tracks the significant refactoring and modernizations applied to the yewtube (mps-youtube fork) terminal application.

## 1. Dependency Modernization (Completed)
- **Metadata Management**: Replaced legacy `pkg_resources` (via `pip._vendor`) with `importlib.metadata`, ensuring compatibility with Python 3.12+ and environments without `pip` internals.
- **Environment Cleanup**: Removed unused or redundant pip modules including `gnureadline` (replaced by `prompt_toolkit`), `requests`, `charset-normalizer`, and `urllib3`, reducing the application footprint.

## 2. CLI & Interactive Shell (Completed)
- **Framework Migration**: Migrated from manual argument parsing to `click`, providing robust help generation and standard CLI patterns.
- **Shell Upgrade**: Replaced standard `readline` with `prompt_toolkit` for all interactive input.
- **Intelligent Completion**: Implemented a `CommandCompleter` with context-aware logic:
    *   Suggests `true`/`false` only for boolean configuration items.
    *   Provides playlist name completions for `open`, `view`, etc.
    *   Provides command-specific sub-argument completions (e.g., for `sort`).
- **Enhanced Exit Flow**: Improved the Ctrl-C exit confirmation prompt to support command history and tab completion.

## 3. Playback Engine & mpv Integration (Completed)
- **Robust IPC Communication**: Rewrote the `mpv` integration to use IPC sockets with improved connection retry logic and secure temporary directory management.
- **Asynchronous Error Capture**: Implemented a background thread to capture `mpv` stderr, allowing the application to detect and report fatal initialization errors (e.g., driver failures) to the UI.
- **Persistent Error Reporting**: Modified the playback loop to display captured errors for 3 seconds before refreshing, ensuring users can diagnose failures.
- **Output Management**:
    *   Muted standard diagnostic output (stdout) to keep the terminal clean.
    *   Unified video suppression logic (fixed crashes when passing both `--no-video` and `--vid=no`).
    *   Removed redundant double-quoting in subprocess arguments.
- **Extensibility**: Added the `aux_mpv_cli_config` setting to allow users to pass arbitrary additional command-line arguments to `mpv`.
- **Keyboard Interactivity**: Restored standard input flow to `mpv` while maintaining clean terminal output, ensuring Space (pause) and Arrow keys (seek) work during playback.

## 4. Metadata & Sorting (Completed)
- **Search Metadata**: Patched `youtubesearchpython` to correctly extract `publishedTime` from YouTube's varying renderer formats.
- **Chronological Sorting**: Implemented a weight-based heuristic to convert relative upload strings (e.g., "2 weeks ago", "5 months ago") into sortable numeric values, fixing alphabetical sorting bugs.
- **Matching Accuracy**: Improved the `best_song_match` algorithm in `album_search` and `spotify_playlist` by fixing duration variance scoring and preventing negative score components.

## 5. Security & Reliability Fixs (Completed)
- **Resource Management**: Implemented context managers for file downloads to prevent file handle leaks during network interruptions.
- **Insecure Temp Files**: Replaced `tempfile.mktemp` with secure `tempfile.mkdtemp` in both `mpv` and `mplayer` backends to prevent race conditions.
- **Safe Process Control**: Refactored the `VLC` backend to use granular process termination (`terminate()`) instead of aggressive system-wide `pkill`.
- **API Modernization**: Replaced all remaining legacy `pafy.call_gdata` calls with modern search and metadata retrieval methods across `generate_playlist`, `spotify_playlist`, and `description_parser`.
- **Input Robustness**: Fixed potential `IndexError` in the duration parser and `ZeroDivisionError` in metadata matching logic.
- **Shadowing Fixes**: Resolved variable shadowing (e.g., `c` loop variable vs `c` color module) to prevent subtle logic errors.

## 6. Code Quality (Completed)
- **Linting & Formatting**: Adopted `ruff` for fast linting and formatting.
- **Consistency**: Standardized on an 80-character line limit and project-wide formatting.
- **Type Safety**: Converted bare `except` blocks to explicit `except Exception:` to prevent catching system signals or masking fatal errors.

## 7. User Interface & Playback Control (Completed)
- **Clean Playback UI**: Streamlined the status bar by replacing the scrolling track size and YouTube ID with a static track title (truncated to 20 characters), providing a cleaner and more readable playback experience.
- **Sequential Autoplay**: Overhauled the `AUTOPLAY` logic to implement a predictable sequential flow through the current song list. This removed redundant random-related-video recursion in favor of stable list traversal.
- **Advanced Navigation**:
    - **Skip to Next**: Re-mapped the `q` key to skip to the next track when `AUTOPLAY` is enabled, rather than stopping playback.
    - **Previous Track ('p')**: Added the `p` key for previous track navigation in both `mpv` and `mplayer` backends.
    - **Help Legend**: Updated the in-player help text to dynamically show `[p] prev [q] next` when autoplay is active.
- **Context-Aware Playback**: Refactored the playback command to provide the player with full list context and a `start_index`. This ensures that navigation keys (`p`/`q`) can correctly traverse the entire original list even when a single track is selected for play.
- **MPlayer Modernization**: Restored standard terminal interactivity (`stdin`) to the `mplayer` backend, ensuring parity with `mpv` for keyboard controls like pause and seek.
- **Diagnostic Transparency**: Improved exception handling in metadata retrieval to surface original error messages, aiding in the diagnosis of private or geo-restricted content.

## 8. Extractor Modernization (yt-dlp Transition)
- **Unified Extraction Layer**: Replaced the legacy `pafy` module with a modern `extractor.py` abstraction. This layer directly interfaces with `yt-dlp` and `youtubesearchpython`, providing a stable and high-performance foundation for all media operations.
- **VideoInfo Abstraction**: Implemented a standardized `VideoInfo` class that ensures consistent metadata access across the entire application, eliminating brittle dictionary-key dependencies.
- **Enhanced Stream Selection**:
    - Leveraged `yt-dlp`'s detailed format metadata for more accurate stream identification (audio vs mixed vs video-only).
    - Improved resolution-based filtering and bitrate-aware sorting for higher quality playback.
    - Added resilient expiry parsing for stream URLs to optimize playback start times.
- **Global terminology migration**: Conducted a project-wide cleanup to remove all legacy `pafy` naming from imports, variables, and global caches (e.g., `g.pafs` -> `g.metadata_cache`).
- **Improved Metadata Retrieval**: Unified search and playlist metadata processing to use modern scraping techniques, significantly reducing "no results" or "extraction failed" errors.
- **Search Fallback Mechanism**: Implemented a robust fallback to `yt-dlp` for video searches when `youtubesearchpython` crashes or fails (common with high-profile artists like 'Lana Del Rey' due to complex shelf renderers).

## 9. Full yt-dlp Migration (Completed)
- **Eliminated Scraping Dependencies**: Successfully migrated the entire application from `youtube-search-python` to an internal `yt-dlp` and direct API-based implementation. This removes fragile HTML scraping dependencies that frequently broke on YouTube UI updates.
- **Unified Search Engine**: All search types (video, playlist, and channel) now use the robust `yt-dlp` search backend with optimized filters (e.g., `sp=EgIQAw%3D%3D` for playlists).
- **High-Performance Discovery**: 
    - **Playlist Loading**: Re-implemented `get_playlist` using `yt-dlp`'s `extract_flat` mode, providing significantly faster loading of large playlists.
    - **Channel Content**: Refactored channel video and playlist retrieval to use `yt-dlp`, ensuring stable metadata across the discovery workflow.
- **Lightweight Suggestions**: Replaced the legacy `Suggestions` class with a direct, asynchronous-ready API call to the Google Suggest service, reducing overhead and improving response times.
- **Advanced Metadata**: 
    - **Comment Extraction**: Re-integrated video comment viewing using `yt-dlp`'s `getcomments` capability.
    - **Dislike Restoration**: Maintained integration with the `Return YouTube Dislike` API alongside `yt-dlp` metadata.

## 10. Search Performance Optimization (Completed)
- **Extractor Filtering**: Optimized `yt-dlp` initialization by restricting allowed extractors to `youtube:search` and `youtube`, cutting search startup time by reducing unnecessary extractor checks.
- **Lazy Extraction**: Enabled `lazy_extract` for all search types, allowing the application to fetch result lists without waiting for detailed metadata for every individual entry.
- **Disk I/O Reduction**: Disabled the `yt-dlp` cache directory for search operations to eliminate unnecessary disk writes during ephemeral queries.

## 11. Architectural Refinements (Completed)
- **Robust Metadata Mapping**: Implemented a `MockPlaylist` compatibility layer to bridge `yt-dlp` raw output with the existing UI, preventing attribute errors during display.
- **Safe Network Handling**: Added timeouts and comprehensive error handling to all network-bound operations (e.g., content-length retrieval and search suggestions).
- **Resolution Resilience**: Hardened the stream selection logic to handle non-standard or malformed resolution strings (e.g., "720p" vs "1280x720") common in `yt-dlp` results.
- **Initialization Integrity**: Improved the main entry point to ensure the application stops immediately on initialization failures, preventing cascaded state errors.
- **Pydantic Configuration**: Migrated the legacy custom configuration system to Pydantic `BaseSettings`. This provides robust type validation, environment variable support, and modern JSON serialization while maintaining full backward compatibility with the existing interactive CLI through a bridge layer.

## 12. Recent Stabilization Updates (Completed)
- **Argparse Unification**: Standardized CLI parsing on `argparse` end-to-end, removing the mixed parser state that previously caused runtime namespace mismatches.
- **CLI Cookie Support**: Added first-class authentication switches:
    - `--cookies <path>` for Netscape-format cookie files.
    - `--cookies-from-browser <browser[:profile]>` for direct browser cookie loading.
- **Cookie Source Hardening**: Removed cookie loading from environment variables and switched to explicit CLI-driven configuration (with `~/.config/mps-youtube/cookies.txt` fallback support retained in extractor logic).
- **Browser-like Request Headers**: Added a shared browser User-Agent/header profile and applied it consistently to `yt-dlp` and direct HTTP requests to reduce anti-bot false positives.
- **Search Error Noise Reduction**: Suppressed the specific YouTube bot-check warning when search results are still successfully returned, while preserving errors for empty/failed searches.
- **Runtime Regression Fixes**:
    - Restored `g.text` binding to fix `module 'mps_youtube.g' has no attribute 'text'`.
    - Hardened CLI argument access in initialization to avoid missing-attribute crashes.
    - Replaced stray runtime `print()` calls with debug logging in playback/config paths.
- **Lint & Consistency Pass**: Ran a project-wide `ruff --fix` cleanup and resolved remaining manual lint issues.

## 13. Hybrid Discovery Engine (Completed)
- **Migrated to `youtube-search-next`**: Switched discovery (search, playlists, channels) to the `youtube-search-next` library for high-speed, maintained access to the YouTube internal API.
- **Unified Extractor**: Updated `extractor.py` to prioritize library-based discovery while retaining `yt-dlp` as a robust fallback for complex metadata and restricted content.
- **Redundant Code Removal**: Deleted the manual `mps_youtube/innertube.py` implementation as its functionality is now superiorly handled by the external library.

## 14. Playback & UI Reliability Updates (Completed)
- **MPRIS Navigation Enhancement**: Added dedicated exit codes (44, 45) for Next and Previous commands. This allows the playback loop to distinguish manual MPRIS skips from natural player exits, ensuring reliable queue progression.
- **Fixed Track Date Display**: 
    - Improved metadata parsing to extract upload ages (e.g., "5 months ago") from `accessibility` labels when standard fields are missing.
    - Increased default column sizes for "Date" and "Time" from 8 to 14 characters to prevent truncation of relative date strings.
- **Stream Extraction Stability**: 
    - Refactored `StreamURLFetcher` to use the `yt-dlp` backend for URL resolution, eliminating 403 Forbidden errors encountered with the library-based fetcher.
    - Fixed a critical playback bug by ensuring `vcodec` and `acodec` are always normalized to lowercase strings (e.g., `'none'`), preventing empty stream lists.
- **Full Channel Metadata**: Implemented a direct Innertube `browse` call for the `user <name>` command to retrieve complete video metadata (age, view counts) which is often stripped in flat playlist listings.
